  <p>
    Noureddine Feathers is a family business that started manufacturing feather
    dusters in the Mediterranean in 1976.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1997, we established our business in Vancouver, BC and started
    distributing our feather dusters all over Canada and the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    Noureddine Feathers sells quality products and provides professional
    services that guarantees customer satisfaction. All our feather dusters are
    handmade from fine, washed, and treated 100% natural, farm-raised ostrich
    feathers. These feathers are collected every year during the summer through
    the natural molting process.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have committed ourselves to produce the best quality products, ensuring
    each handmade piece is beautiful and durable to meet all of your dusting
    needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to feather dusters, we sell lambswool dusters, ostrich feathers,
    and ostrich eggshells.
