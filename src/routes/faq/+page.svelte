        Where do your ostrich feathers come from?
      </p>
      <p>
        We are EU certified and import our ostrich feathers from South Africa. They are 100% natural and come from farm-raised ostrich.

        Why ostrich feathers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ostrich feathers have millions of separate, wispy filaments that collect and hold dust rather than just move it about. They are magnetic and leave no electrostatic charge, so metal, glass, and plastic stay dust free longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to other bird feathers, ostrich feathers have long barbs (the branch-like strands that run out from the feathers shaft) that are perfect for picking up dust, which make them good for sensitive objects. Ostrich feathers are particularly lightweight, soft, and gentle on delicate surfaces, providing a scratch-free experience, which makes them especialluy suited for home and office furniture and equipment.

        How do I clean ostrich feather dusters?
      </p>
      <p>
        After use, gently shake the dust off and turn the duster between your hands. The feathers will immediately recover their fluffiness. You can also gently rinse it with cold water and air dry.
